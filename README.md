# Snake
Snake is a common video game where the player maneuvers a line which
grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The
player controls a square and as it moves forward, it leaves behind a
trail, resembling a moving snake. The player attempts to eat items byu
running unto them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the
snake longer so controlling it is progressively more difficult.
